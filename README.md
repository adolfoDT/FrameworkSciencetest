These are test exercises, done in simple python scripts, they were done in python 3.9, to execute them follow 
the following steps:
1.-Create you virtual enviroment: python -m venv enviroment
2.- Install the libraries from the requirements file: pip install -r requirements.txt
3.- Just execute each script for example python exercise_1.py



NOTES:
- A sql server database hosted on AWS was created (user and password comes in the code)

- For exercise_3.py:
For exercise_3. py i tried to use SES but i didÂ´t implent it because i am using a free trial account, and
i have to wait a minimun of 24 hours for a answers.
The finally porpuse of the exercise 3 can be resolved in differents ways, a queakly and dirty way was implemented
Another solution could be to create a table with differents datas that you known that could comes and if 
a different data appears you cand add a view for the users to add directly into you administrator app

-For more information of each scripts you will see the comments.
